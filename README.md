# CSC-490-SeniorProject
To run the program, it must be opened in the IDE, and the computer running it must have PowerPoint 2013 or 2016 installed.
Simple press the Build Project button, and then Run the project to automatically have the Add-In Open in PowerPoint. From there, any powerpoint presentation can be loaded and used.
In the Add-Ins tab in PowerPoint, there will be text fields to enter the total time given to present, and your total number of slides. Pressing submit will confirm and lock in your time given to present, and how many slides there are.
From here the PowerPoint presentation can be run and the program will function accordingly.
After the PowerPoint presentation is finished, a new folder will be created on your C:/ drive, called DataFiles. Inside of DataFiles will be a file called lapTimes.csv
This file contains all of the information from your presentation and all other presentations that are ran while the Add-In is open.
